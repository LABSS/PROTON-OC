# PROTON-OC

PROTON-OC is an agent-based model that explores the dynamics and processes that lead to recruitment into organized crime. The simulator investigates a wide variety of factors in the individual sphere and focuses on the social relationships between agents. Detailed information on the theoretical background, model development process, and model functioning available here.

The simulation is developed by LABSS-CNR as a follow-up of [the PROTON project](http://web.archive.org/web/20230601024527/https://www.projectproton.eu/)

Results from the original simulator have been published on the [Journal of Quantitative Criminology.](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10940-020-09489-z)

A quick presentation of the ideas behind the project, and of the main results, can be watched in the following:
